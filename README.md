# Cat Tickler

Cat Tickler - A conceptual exercise for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree

## Introduction

This is an exercise to apply separation of concerns to a simple project.

## Instructions

Tickle the cats and they will show their gratitude by remembering how many
times you tickled them!!!
Use the top navigation to change cat.

The admin panel allows you to change the name of the cat, the URL of the cat's
picture, the description of the picture (i.e., the HTML `alt` attribute),, and
the numbers of clicks (if you feel like cheating on the number of times you
actually tickled the cat!).

Have fun tickling the cats!
